## Definitions
- An equation is any mathematical expression that contains an equals sign (=).

- Equations can involve numbers as well as variables.
    - 12/3 = 4, 
    - x/3 = 4
    - 4a<sup>2</sup> -1 = 0
    - 6x+5y=10 

- A __coefficient__ is a number that is multiplied by a variable. 
    - For example, 4 is the coefficient of  a<sup>2</sup> in 4a<sup>2</sup> -1 = 0

- The __solutions__ to an equation are the values that can be substituted for variables to make the equation true.
    - For example, consider the equation x/3 = 4
        - Since we know 12/3 = 4 is a true equation, we know the equation x/3 = 4 has the solution of x = 12

- The __degree__ of an equation is the highest power of a variable that appears in the equation.
    - For example, the equation 4a<sup>2</sup> -1 = 0 has a degree of 2, since the highest power that appears is a<sup>2</sup>. The equations x/3 = 4 and 6x + 5y = 10 both have degree 1

- A linear equation is an equation with degree 
    -  x/3 = 4 is a linear equation with one variable. 
    - 6x+5y=10 is a linear equation with two variables.


## Properties of Equality
- Much like addition and multiplication, equality has its own properties. These properties will be important for solving equations.

- In the following table, a, b, and c are any real numbers.

    | Property | Rule | Explanation |
    |----------|------|-------------| 
    |Symmetric| if a = b, then b = a | If two things  are equal, it does not matter which is written on the left-hand side (LHS) or right-hand side (RHS) of the equals sign. |
    | Transitive | if a = b and b = c, then a = c | If two values are equal, and one is also equal to a third value, then all three of the values are equal. We can write these equalities in any combination. |
    |Addition| if a = b, then a + c = b + c | If we add the same number to both sides of an equation, then the resulting equation is true. |
    |Subtraction| if a = b, then a - c = b - c| If we subtract the same number from both sides of an equation, then the resulting equation is true.
    |Multiplication| if a = b, then a * c  = b * c | If we multiply both sides of an equation by the same number, then the resulting equation is true. |
    |Division| if a = b, then a/c = b/c | If we divide both sides of an equation by the same number, then the resulting equation is true.|


- Pay special attention to the properties of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. As a group, these properties tell us that as long as we apply the same operation to both sides of an equation, the equation remains true.


## Solving a linear equation with one variable
We can follow this general process to find the solution to a linear equation in one variable.
1. Simplify both sides of the equation, using the order of operations.
2. Move all constant terms to one side of the equation. (use the Addition/Subtraction properties of equality.)
3. Move all variable terms to the other side of the equation. (Use the Addition/Subtraction properties of equality.)
4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable. (Use the Multiplication/Division properties of equality.)
