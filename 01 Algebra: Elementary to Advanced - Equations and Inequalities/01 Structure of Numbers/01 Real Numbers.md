 ## Natural Numbers "ℕ"

- A natural number is a non-negative integer that starts from 1 and continues indefinitely, used for counting and ordering objects.
- In mathematical notation, natural numbers are typically represented as N = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}. They are the simplest and most fundamental type of numbers in mathematics.


## Whole Numbers "|W"

- Begin natural numers with 0

## Integers "ℤ or zahlen"

- ![Integers](https://thirdspacelearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Integers-us-what-is-card-image.png)

 - 1 ∈ Z ([Integer] One is an element of [a set of all integers]
 - 1 ∉ Z ([Integer] One is not an element of [a set of all integers]

## Rational Numbers "Q"

- Rational numbers are ratios or sometimes called fractions of integers
- {(a/b) | a, b ∈ Z, b ≠ 0 }
  - A over B and then I write a couple of things. This bar by the way means, such that, so the way that we have this so far is the set of all numbers A over B, such that A and B are integers. I'm allowed to pick any integer I want, two thirds, one half, three fifths, pick whatever you want as long as of course, and I think we all know this, you can't divide by zero, so __you're not allowed to pick your denominator to be zero. Any other values are fine, as long as your denominator is not zero__.
  - not every number is rational. You may know that pi cannot be written as a fraction. So we'd say of course that like pi is not rational. When you are not rational, some like this, you're called irrational, so pi is irrational.
 
 ## Real Numbers
 - any number with a decimal expansion (7.00, pi 3.14159)
